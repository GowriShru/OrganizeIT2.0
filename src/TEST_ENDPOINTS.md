## Testing from Frontend

### Browser Console Test:
```javascript
// Test metrics endpoint
fetch('https://PROJECT_ID.supabase.co/functions/v1/make-server-efc8e70a/metrics/dashboard', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer ANON_KEY'
  }
})
.then(r => r.json())
.then(console.log)
```

---

## Success Indicators

### ✅ Healthy Endpoint:
- Returns HTTP 200
- Returns valid JSON
- Response time < 500ms
- No error messages in response

### ❌ Failing Endpoint:
- Returns HTTP 500
- Returns error object: `{"error": "..."}`
- May timeout
- Console shows error logs

---

## Troubleshooting

### If you see 500 errors:
1. Check Supabase Edge Function is deployed
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Check Supabase logs in dashboard
4. Ensure KV store table exists (optional)

### If you see 401 errors:
1. Check Authorization header is included
2. Verify ANON_KEY is correct
3. Check CORS settings

### If you see timeout errors:
1. Check Supabase project is active
2. Verify network connectivity
3. Check Edge Function deployment status

---

## Expected Behavior (After Fixes)

**All endpoints should return 200 OK with data**, even if:
- KV store table doesn't exist
- Database connection fails
- Environment variables are missing
- Network issues occur

This is because all endpoints now have fallback data that ensures the platform remains functional.

---

## Automated Testing

### Run all endpoint tests:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
BASE_URL="https://PROJECT_ID.supabase.co/functions/v1/make-server-efc8e70a"
AUTH="Authorization: Bearer ANON_KEY"

echo "Testing OrganizeIT Endpoints..."

echo "1. Health Check"
curl -s "$BASE_URL/health" -H "$AUTH" | jq .

echo "2. Metrics Dashboard"
curl -s "$BASE_URL/metrics/dashboard" -H "$AUTH" | jq .

echo "3. Current Alerts"
curl -s "$BASE_URL/alerts/current" -H "$AUTH" | jq .

echo "4. Service Health"
curl -s "$BASE_URL/services/health" -H "$AUTH" | jq .

echo "5. Notifications"
curl -s "$BASE_URL/notifications" -H "$AUTH" | jq .

echo "6. Projects"
curl -s "$BASE_URL/projects" -H "$AUTH" | jq .

echo "7. FinOps Costs"
curl -s "$BASE_URL/finops/costs" -H "$AUTH" | jq .

echo "8. ESG Carbon"
curl -s "$BASE_URL/esg/carbon" -H "$AUTH" | jq .

echo "All tests complete!"
```

Save as `test-endpoints.sh` and run with `bash test-endpoints.sh`
